# Wireless_channel_simulation

In this project I simulate a wireless channel in diffrent conditions:<br/>
1-with QPSK modulation<br/>
2-with 16QAM modulation<br/>
3-with hamming encoding<br/>

All the above conditions will be tested with SNR of 10, 1 and 0.1<br/>
And aditionaly all three conditions will have an estimatiation of bit rate error in percentage<br/>
